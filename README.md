Mobile Price Classification with Machine Learning
In this project, I built a classification model to predict the price range of mobile phones using various hardware features like RAM, battery power, and pixel resolution.
I began by exploring the dataset for null values, duplicates, and basic statistics. Then, I visualized feature relationships using scatter plots and histograms to identify impactful variables.
Feature selection was based on correlation with the target variable, followed by data scaling using StandardScaler for better model performance.
I trained multiple models including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifiers (SVC). The tuned SVC with linear kernel achieved an impressive 96.75% test accuracy.
Evaluation included confusion matrices and classification reports to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
